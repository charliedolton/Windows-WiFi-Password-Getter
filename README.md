# Windows-WiFi-Password-Getter

This is a python payload that if run on any windows computer will return the names and passwords of every wifi network the PC has connected to in the form of an email. 

You have to edit a few things in the code. There are 2 email addresses you will have to put in: the first one is where the data will be emailed to; the second one is where they should be emailed from. They can be the same address. You will need to enter the password for the email address you are sending from. You also need to know the SMTP server address and port number. These can usually be found online.

All you need to then is execute it on the machine.
